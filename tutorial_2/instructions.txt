(1) Download the latest version of SimpleITK - brach STRAW not the master branch
$ git clone -b "STRAW" --single-branch "https://github.com/blowekamp/SimpleITK.git"

(2) Perform compilation with Superbuild - this downloads ITK and compiles it. 

(3) Or you can use the precompiled libraries
"/vol/bitbucket/oo2113/SimpleITK/Build/SimpleITK-build/Wrapping"
"/vol/bitbucket/oo2113/SimpleITK/Build/SimpleITK-build/lib"
which should be added into your $PYTHONPATH
